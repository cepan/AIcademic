    "140-160": " of zeros only on the diagonal that are nonzero elements and these nonzero elements I call singular values and what we will also assume is that these singular values are sorted in the decreasing order so the largest singular value comes first and then the second largest and so on and then the last exam Atrix that we have is the matrix V and",
    "160-180": " this is the matrix that we will call that it stores the right singular vectors so the size of this matrix will be n times R where n is the number of columns in our original matrix a and again R in this case is some small number we can think of this R as basically being the rank of the matrix a",
    "180-200": " so what we have so far is we have a way or at least conceptually we have a way to take our matrix a and represent it as a product of three different matrices where the matrix Sigma has this special structure that it's a diagonal matrix so what do I mean by diagonal matrix as I said is that it only has the nonzero",
    "200-220": " values on the diagonal and everything else is full of zeros so I just gave you a mathematical way of looking at how matrix a can be represented as a product of three matrices but now let's look at it kind of graphically so the way this look works is the following I'm given the input data matrix a that has M rows",
    "220-240": " and n columns and I want to represent this matrix as a product of three matrices u Sigma and V transpose where I can think of the matrix U as a very thin so very few columns but M rows matrix so something that's thin and long then I have this special matrix Sigma that only",
    "240-260": " has values on the diagonal elements and the rest is zero and then I have this other matrix V transpose that has a small number of rows are rows but it has n columns so basically what we did in a sense is we will take this big matrix a and represent it as a product of a thin",
    "260-280": " and narrow matrix a diagonal matrix and a very long and of low height matrix V so this is one way how to look at this in terms of the product of three matrices here's us again a different way of looking at it so now I can think of this as a that matrix a is a sum of different matrices where basically I took the same thing as",
    "280-300": " I had before but now I'm representing it as outer products of different vectors right so I'm in some sense taking the left singular vector multiplying it with the singular value value and then the right singular vector and then I add to it the second left singular vector the singular value and second right singular",

    "320-340": " that is called the SVD SVD theorem that says that it is always possible to decompose a real matrix a into this product of matrix of matrices u Sigma and V transpose and when I say a real matrix I mean a matrix where its values are real numbers right so not complex",

    "360-380": " decomposed into exactly one matrix you a unit matrix Sigma and unique matrix V so that's the first thing the second thing is that matrix issue and V are what is called column orthonormal which means that the columns of U and we have Euclidean length one so the sum of the",
    "380-400": " squared values of the in each column of these two matrices equals one and then the other one is that these columns are orthogonal which means that if I take two columns of U or if I take two columns of V and I multiplied them with each other if I dot product them with each other I get a zero right so in what this means that both",
    "400-420": " you and v4 in some sense form a basis which means that I have each each column has Euclidean length while one this is called this is part of the normal and orthogonal orthogonal ''tis that the inner product is zero between different columns of a of a given matrix so that's the first important thing about the",
    "420-440": " structure of columns U and V and the important thing about the structure of the of the of the matrix Sigma is that it's diagonal which means that the entries of matrix Sigma which we call singular values are all positive um and they are sorted in the decreasing order which means that Sigma 1 is greater than equal to Sigma 2 2 Sigma 3 and they are",
    "440-460": " all greater than 0 so what do we know is that for any given matrix a there is a unique set of matrices u v and sigma that are that we are able to compute in order to decompose a that U and V in the columns of it are orthonormal which means unit length and orthogonal and matrix Sigma is this diagonal matrix",
    "460-480": " with nonzero elements on it so basically the singular values on it let me give you now an example of how we can think about this so let's think about the users to movies matrix right so let's think of our via Netflix or user review website or we can think of ourselves as",
    "480-500": " a movie selling the business and what we do is the following we have a set of people and we have a set of movies right and every every person goes and watches some set of movies and they tell us whether they like that movie or not so a value of 1 means that they didn't like the movie that much and 5 means they really enjoyed the movie ok so every column in this matrix corresponds to a",

    "520-540": " to decompose this matrix using the singular value decomposition so we want to decompose it in terms of this long and narrow matrix U the diagonal matrix Sigma and matrix we so if we if we do this the way we can think of of these different elements of this matrix is basically in",
    "540-560": " some sense we want to discover concepts right in some sense we would like to discover that in the matrix that I gave you that basically we have the set of science-fiction movies and we have also a set of users who like science fiction movies and I have we have a set of other users right the bottom three users that all like romance movies and they don't",
    "560-580": " really like the sci-fi movies so in some sense movies break into group into two groups one group is about sci-fi the other one is about romance and also users break into the two groups into the kind of sci-fi lovers and romance movie lovers so now basically",
    "580-600": " this is what SVD will allow us to figure out so if you take this matrix let's say I type it into MATLAB and do the singular value decomposition this is what we obtain so we obtain our matrix U we obtain our matrix Sigma and we obtain our matrix V transpose and here is how how we can think about the what we learn",
    "600-620": " from the singular value decomposition so the first thing is the columns of U we can think of this as concepts right so for example the first column of U corresponds to the to the sci-fi concept and the second column of U corresponds to the Romans concept so what is what we learn from here is that for example the",
    "620-640": " first five users really strongly belong to the sci-fi concept and the second five users second three users correspond heavily to the Romans concept in terms of this we can think of in some sense that both matrix U as a user to concept",

    "660-680": " as a user to concept similarity matrix then we have the single values Sigma and here what we think of this is that every every value is nonzero and it's positive right non-negative so we can think of this as the strength of every concept so in our",
    "680-700": " case we would see that the strength of our sci-fi concept is is ha is higher than the strength of our romance concept right and then we need to also explain in the matrix we and the way we can think of matrix is we can think of it as a movie 2 concept matrix right in a sense that it said it tells us that that",
    "700-720": " the first three movies heavily correspond to the belong to the first concept while the last two movies heavily correspond to the to this to the second concept which we named the romance concept of course of course in both cases we also have this third concept that that in some sense has very low strength so we can kind of ignore it",
    "720-740": " and it just models in some sense the noise in our data okay so this is one way how we basically we can already go and learn something from from the SVD right we took some matrix of data points and we perform the SVD and very quickly we saw that basically we have two two concepts of the of domains of lots of",
    "740-760": " strengths the first only we were able to interpret as the concept of sci-fi movies the second one a concept of romance movies and then for every user we know how much they belong to the to each concept so for example the first user heavily belongs to the sci-fi concept and relatively little belongs to the romance concept and then also for",
    "760-780": " every movie we know what concepts is belongs it belongs to so for example the first movie heavily belongs to the to the first concept and much less to the second concept it also belongs with heavily to the third concept but as we see from our matrix Sigma the third concept has a very low overall strength",
    "780-800": " so it's not so important in explaining the data so in what is the first interpretation of our SVD basically the first interpretation is that we can take this let's say uses users to movie matrix and we can interpret our our data in terms of movies users and the concepts or different genres or topics right so we can think of you as",
