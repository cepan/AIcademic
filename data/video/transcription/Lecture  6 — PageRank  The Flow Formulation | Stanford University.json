    "20-40": " the important scores and we will see that our initial formulation is broken so we will then later fix it but for now we will we will just come up with the initial formulation and this is called the flow formulation for the pag rank algorithm so here is the idea the idea is that we think of links on a web graph as votes right so the idea is that a page or a node in a graph is as",
    "40-60": " important as the number of links it has of course the first question is what kind of links are we talking about are we talking about in links are we talking about outgoing links for example we will look at in links in links because in links are kind of harder to fake than out links it's very easy to have a page with lots of outlinks it's harder to have a page that lots of other pages on",
    "60-80": " the web point to so that's the first question the second thing is that it's not enough just to consider in links but we also have to consider where this link is coming from so for example u a link from a given web page maybe from stanford.edu is more important than a link from some other web page that only",
    "80-100": " receives very few uh in links all right so the idea is that not all in links are equal kind of links coming from important pages are worth more and here here is basically the idea the idea is that uh an importance of a page is is the in some sense depends on the importances of other pages that point to",
    "100-120": " it so we kind of we have this recursive definition where importance of your given page depends on the importances of the others and this importance then kind of gets passed on further through the graph so this is the first idea and just to give you how an intuition how page rank scores of a graph look like here in this slide I'm showing you uh small a",
    "120-140": " small graph um with a set of directed edges and here in this graph the size of the noes is proportional to its page rank scores and here I normalize the paging scores so that they sum to 100 and what do we see is the following we see for example that that node B has a very high page rank score the reason why",
    "140-160": " it has high page rank score is because it has lots of lots of other Pages point to it for example node C also has a relatively High page range score even though it receives only a single incoming link um the reason why C has a high page rank score is because this very important node B is pointing to it",
    "160-180": " and then for example you can see that this very small um uh dark red uh links nodes have relatively small pag ring scores for example the pag ring score of node D is higher than the pag rank of node a because uh D points to a for example we see that the node e has kind",
    "180-200": " of intermediate page rank score and E points to B and so on right so the results we get from page rank are kind of intuitive and then correspond to our intuitive notion of how important is a node is a node in a graph so now what we will look at is how do we compute these kind of scores or importances of nodes in the graph so the idea is the",
    "200-220": " following the idea is that we will come up with a simple recursive formulation where we where we think of each link as a vote and we think of the importance of a given vote to be proportional to the importance of the source web page that is casting this Vote or that is creating a link to the destination so the way we think about this is the following let's",
    "220-240": " think that we have a page J with an importance R subj and for this let this importance be just some number and think that that the page J has n outgoing links right so then the way we will do say is that now this importance RJ of payj basically gets split on all of its",
    "240-260": " outgoing links um evenly so the each link gets r subj divided by n votes or amount of importance to spread to the Target so so now this is how the importance gets from J to the pages it points to and in a similar way we can Define the the importance of J as the sum of the votes that it receives on its",
    "260-280": " in links so if we look at the simple uh graph here um at the bottom the idea is that the importance R subj of web page J is simply the importance of page I the green page divided by three because page I has three outlinks plus importance of",
    "280-300": " page K divided by four y by four because page K has four outlinks one two 3 and four so this is how we compute the the score of um of page J and now that we have the score of page J this score further gets propagated outside of J",
    "300-320": " along the three outgoing links so each of these links gets the importance of of node J divided by three and this is basically all that is to this formulation is every note collects the importances of the pages that point to it upd has its own importance and then kind of propagate it uh through through",
    "320-340": " their neighbors so the idea is that basically this votes flow through the through the network so that's why this is called a flow formulation or a flow model of pag ring and just to give you an idea how this would work out here is a very small um web graph you know from prehistoric times when the web only contained three websites a m and Y and",
    "340-360": " imagine that this is the structure right so y has a self link and then points to a a points points to m m points backwards and so on and our initial idea as we said before is the vote is is uh from an important page is worth more so a page is more important if it's pointed",
    "360-380": " to by other important pages so as I as I kind of hinted on the previous slide we will assign an important score R to a page J and we will call this important score rank so this is where the page rank uh terminology comes from so we we call this importance to be Rank and now",
    "380-400": " the our formula that we have for computing page rank is very simple we simply do say that the important score of page J is is simply the sum of all the other pages I that point to it importance of that page I divided by the out degree of the page right so now what",
    "400-420": " we can do is basically this means that for every node in the network we obtain a separate equation so for example the importance of node Y in my network is simply the importance of y ided two plus importance of Aid two so why is that because y has two outgoing links one",
    "420-440": " links point points to itself so it's y ID two and then similarly node a has two outgoing links so we take R A and divide it by two for example if you say what is the importance of node M importance of node m is importance of node a divided by two again why divided by two because",
    "440-460": " node a has two outgoing links and half of the half of its importance goes to a and half of its importance goes goes to Y as we saw here right so now it almost seems like we are done right we have this set of equations that we would like to solve right we have three equations three unknowns no constraints and we",
    "460-480": " want to solve this the problem is that this has no unique solution um the reason is that the the system is under constraint so basically all solutions will will be we can find an infinite set of solutions to this set of equations and all what these Solutions will have in common they will be equivalent up to",
    "480-500": " the scaling Factor so we need we need an additional constraint so the constraint we will add to our system is to say that our paging scores have to sum to one so r r y r a plus RM has to be equal to one so now with this additional equation we can basically have now three unknowns four equations we can go solve this for",
    "500-520": " this small graph we can go solve this by hand and we would come up with the with the with the solution which are our initial pay page rank scores right so for example y has score of 5 over2 a has score of 5 over2 and then M has score of 1/5 right so it seems like as that we",
    "520-540": " are done right so we could use any kind of um linear system equation solving method for example gausian elimination um um and be able to compute the importances of nodes in the graph um you know this approach would work well for very small graphs but it won't it it",
    "540-560": " won't work for a for a size of the web graph so basically for a graph where we have a billion web pages because it would mean that we have a billion of equations a system of billion of equations that we would want to solve so we need a different formulation"
