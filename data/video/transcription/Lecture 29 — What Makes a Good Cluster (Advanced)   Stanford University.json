    "0-20": " so if we want to be able to detect clusters the first thing we need to do is to figure out how do we Define a good cluster how do we Define a good community in in the graph structure point of view so the way we think about this is the following our input is a graph right a graph on a set of vertices V these are the circles and a set of edges or connections e and in our case",
    "20-40": " these connections these lines are simply undirected unweighted lines right and what we would want to do is we can Define what is called a graph partitioning task where the idea is that we want to divide the vertices of our Network into two sets into sets A and B in such a way that uh you know we will",
    "40-60": " identify clusters so the question is how do we Define what is a good uh cluster in the network the way to think about how do we Define a good cluster I have already implicitly spoken about it right so kind of intuitively what we want is to say what makes a good cluster what makes is a good what what makes a good",
    "60-80": " cluster is to maximize the number of within cluster connections right so people notes that are in the same cluster we want them to to link to each other and then we want to minimize the number of connections that go between clusters right so we would like to say if this set of nodes let's call it a is a cluster we want lots of connections",
    "80-100": " between the members of the cluster and we want few connections to the rest of the network right so we want this cluster to be kind of in an easy way separated from the rest of the network right so this is our set B in this case so for now we have a very simple task we want to take our graph split it into two pieces where um the piece that we are",
    "100-120": " splitting away has lots of edges between the members of the piece and few connections to the rest of the network so this way we now uh arrive to the first definition of today's module which we will talk about graph Cuts right so the idea is that we want to express this cluster quality ality as a",
    "120-140": " function of the what is called The Edge cut of the cluster right so the idea is that cut is a set of edges with only one end point in the cluster so simply if I say what is the cut of a set a this is simply a summation over all the edges where one end point of an edge is in the set a and the other end point is in the",
    "140-160": " um outside the set a and I'm summing up together the weights of those edges right in our case we assume that every weight of the edge is one so all this is doing is basically counting how many edges are pointing outside the set a so for example if I have this graph here on six nodes and if I think of set a to be",
    "160-180": " this yellow set then um what is the cut score or what is the cut of this set a the cut of the set a is two uh why is that because there are two edges the first black Edge and the second black black Edge that point outside the set a right so one end point is in the set and the other end point is outside the set",
    "180-200": " right note number one is in the set and Noe number five is outside and we have two such edges so the cut score equals two so one option we already know for example based on this how we would go and identify clusters the idea would be that I go and find sets of nodes such that that are kind of very easy to be",
    "200-220": " cut right that their cut score is small which means I have to cut a small number of edges to separate this Set uh from the rest of the network the problem however with this is that if I use this cut score to find good clusters um I I can find kind of un interesting degenerate Solutions so the problem with",
    "220-240": " the cut score is that um it only kind of considers the edges pointing outside the cluster and not the edges inside the cluster here's an example right I have this graph with where intuitively we think that there are two clusters there is a cluster of red sets of set of nodes and there is a cluster of kind of the green set of nodes and what we would",
    "240-260": " like to do is that we would say oh the best cut the optimal cut in this network in in in some sense is cutting here along the blue line but for example if you say what is the cut in this network that optimizes the cut score that basically gives us the lowest possible cut score would be cutting here right would be cutting this lonely green node",
    "260-280": " away from the network because all we need to do to separate this node out is to cut a single edge what we would like to do intuitively we would like to cut here where the blue line goes right because we are cutting two edges and kind of nicely split the graph into two pieces so the question is how should we modify our cut score definition such that um you know the in some sense the",
    "280-300": " optimal cut we will find is here um in the middle of the graph the way the way we do the the modification is to realize what are the problems there are two problems with the cut Score first one is that it only considers kind of external connections to the cluster only kind of edges pointing outside the CL cluster",
    "300-320": " and it doesn't consider internal connections right connections between the members of the cluster so a fix that um helps here is a a metric called conductance right so conductance is a is a way to incorporate the connectivity of the group to the to the rest of the network relative to the internal",
    "320-340": " connectivity of a given group so the way we will do this is the following uh we will Define um notion of conductance a given set a we denote conductance with a Greek letter F and conductance is very simple all it is doing is to saying um the first we count the number of edges",
    "340-360": " where one end point is in the set a and the other end point is outside the set a this is nothing else than the cut of the set a right we have already defined this but now we divide the cut we by what is called the volume right we divide the cut by the volume of set a and how how do we Define the volume volume is simply",
    "360-380": " the total weight of the edges with at least one end point in the set a in other words volume is simply the sum of the degrees of all the nodes that that are in the set a and a degree of a node is simply the number of connections adjacent to a given node right so intuitively what we are doing is we are",
    "380-400": " taking the number of edges that point outside the cluster this is the cut and then we divide this by the number of edges that are in some sense inside the cluster plus the edges that point outside right and the lower this ratio the lower the FI the better the cluster we have found um one one thing that deserves to to be set here is that we",
    "400-420": " have this minimum um here and the idea is that we can think about the set a to be less than half of the size of of the graph right so the idea is if I have set a to be very big then um the volume of a can kind of overpower overpower the whole thing so the good thing to think about is that the the size of set a is",
    "420-440": " less than the uh the the number of vertices divided by two and then the 2 m minus volume of a kind of never takes over so that's that's basically the idea and um why would we want to use this Criterion is because it produces more balanced partitions in some sense it produces pieces clusters that are kind",
    "440-460": " of of comparable sizes um to give you an example here I have a graph uh with the blue nodes and imagine that the red nodes are what I call set a and now I can ask what is the conductance of this set a and in the first case I have two nodes um what is the cut score I'm",
    "460-480": " cutting two edges right I cut an edge here and I cut an edge there so I get two what is the sum of the degrees I have the first node has degree one the second node has degree three so the sum of the degrees is four so two over 4 equals .5 right so conductance of the set a on the left hand on the left hand side example",
    "480-500": " is2 for example if I think of set a um in the example of the right to be the cut that goes uh through the red line then if I do the counting it turns out I have to cut six edges and what is the sum of the degrees of the nodes that are inside the set a it turns out to be 92 so 6 over 92 is",
    "500-520": " 0.065 right so in some sense the the the um conductance score of the set uh a on the right is 10 times better or 10 times lower the than conductance score of the set um on the left so this means that my um uh that on the right hand side we",
    "520-540": " found a 10 times better cluster than on the left hand side"
