    "0-20": " so basically let me quickly summarize what we have learned so far right so if we want to apply spectrographic graph partitioning to find two clusters in a given graph there are three steps we have to go through in the first step we have to do what is called pre-processing where we construct a matrix representation of a graph in the second",
    "20-40": " step we go and compute the eigen value decomposition of this of this graph by identifying eigenvalues and eigenvectors in particular we are interested in the second smallest eigenvalue lambda 2 and the corresponding eigenvector x and then once we have the called the vector x all we have to do is we have to go and do",
    "40-60": " the grouping where we basically look at the components of X and determine which nodes belong to the set a and which nodes belong to the set B right kind of who belongs to the left partition who belongs to the right partition so let me now give you an example right so in the pre-processing step I take our graph G and compute the laplacian matrix l in",
    "60-80": " the second step then we do the eigenvalue decomposition where basically we take our L when we find a set of eigen values and a set of eigen vectors to this matrix L we take the second smallest eigen value and the corresponding eigen vector here it is",
    "80-100": " right we take this this one out so here are now all the nodes 1 2 1 2 6 and these are the corresponding entries of the eigen vector and what we find for example is that now what we have to do is we have to group these nodes right we would like to group these nodes into two clusters corresponding to the embedding or the labels of the nodes that we have",
    "100-120": " in the corresponding eigen vector so how do we do this grouping doing the grouping is very simple we basically go and sort the components of of this of vector X and identify clusters by splitting the vector into so a naive approach this to this case would be to",
    "120-140": " ask what are the corresponding values that are negative what are the corresponding values that are positive right so if this is our vector X we would split it here between nodes 3 & 4 these are all the notes that are on the right-hand side of the zero these are all the notes on the left-hand side of the zero notice that some of the node",
    "140-160": " labels equals to zero exactly as we said we said it should be also note is the sum of the squares of the values equals to one which is again exactly as it should be so what this basically means is now by splitting this vector in in half into kind of the positive part and the negative part we identified the two clusters here is the cluster a which is",
    "160-180": " composed of nodes 1 2 3 and the cluster B that is composed of nodes 4 5 and 6 so I have an a and I have a B right so basically what the components of second smallest eigen vector did it basically embedded the nodes on a line assigned them positive and negative values we",
    "180-200": " take all the positive nodes put them into cluster a take all the negative notes notes with negative values put them in the cluster B so now if I give you a bit more interesting example here I have graph on the Left G that you see it has two clusters I computed the graph laplacian I computed the lambda two and",
    "200-220": " the corresponding eigenvector x and all I did here is now I sorted the vector X to write the corresponding eigenvector to the second smallest eigen value by by by the entries and what you see very nicely is there is a set of components that has a negative value and a set of components that has a positive value so",
    "220-240": " basically the eigen values or the entries of the eigen vector with a positive value correspond to one cluster and the remaining ones correspond to the second cluster of course you can now start asking what is there anything interesting about the eigenvectors that correspond to let's say the third",
    "240-260": " smallest eigenvalue the fourth smallest eigenvalue and so on and just to for example show you what happens that the first case I'll show you is a graph that I have here that actually contains four small clusters if the graph contains four small clusters and I still compute lambda two and the corresponding eigenvector x two what what I show you",
    "260-280": " here is now the components of this eigenvector and you see how how the entry is now first are split into two clusters kind of above zero and below zero but then you actually find that here we have these different steps right so basically we have the first the two clusters and then each of the two clusters has two",
    "280-300": " small clusters embedded in them and we see this kind of from the structure of the components of the second eigenvector very nicely so the question is if I have multiple clusters how would I go identify them so let me just show you some examples how to do this for example if this is my graph G the same as I had",
    "300-320": " before I have my laplacian matrix L that I do eigendecomposition for example here are the components of vector x1 and they all have exactly the same value so exactly as we said and as we have proven but for example the components of the third smallest eigen vector are the following and now what you see here is",
    "320-340": " for example that this is the bottom cluster this is the second cluster then this would be the third cluster and here these components correspond to the fourth cluster so basically what does this mean this gives us now an idea of how do we go if we want to partition a graph not in two clusters but in K of",
    "340-360": " them there are two possible approaches one approach is to do a recursive by partitioning it's basically taking the full graph split it in two and now for each of the two pieces again kind of try to split it in two and we keep applying this recursively in until we are getting kind of smaller and smaller pieces and another idea is to basically cluster",
    "360-380": " using multiple eigenvalues and multiple eigenvectors so basically the idea is that for every node in the graph we take our laplacian matrix compute the eigenvalue decomposition and now we take the second eigenvector the third eigenvector for tagging vector which basically means that every node of the graph is now described by a small vector",
    "380-400": " of values and now we can apply k-means or something like that to to identify the clusters so basically the idea would be that we take the graph compute the laplacian matrix formula play chien matrix what we will do is for every node I we will come up with its corresponding in some sense",
    "400-420": " ordinates right so we will take the coordinate I of second smallest eigenvector coordinate I of the third smallest eigen vector and so on and so forth and now that every note is described by a set of coordinates we can run k-means that we have already discussed how to use to identify k clusters and it turns out that in",
    "420-440": " practice this method works really well so with this we have finished the discussion of spectral clustering and basically given a graph how to find individual clusters of nodes in it"
