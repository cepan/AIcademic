    "20-40": " data is that we had this big bulky bipartite structure that that we had to fit and basically search over this affiliation graph so what we will do now is basically relax the the model a bit and the idea now is to say rather than than for every note to have 01 type of membership in a sense that I can either be a member of a given Community or a",
    "40-60": " non-member now we want to actually model the strengths of every note Community membership so the idea will be that we will have this non- negative strength um of every note being a member of a given community of course if a strength of membership is zero this means a note is not member of the community and if the",
    "60-80": " strength of a membership is very high this means that the node is very kind of active part or an active member of a given Community the way we will think of these strengths we will we will label them as f u comma a where U is the name of the node and a is the name of the community so we will call this uh membership strengths F and they are non-",
    "80-100": " negative values so basically zero means no membership and anything greater than zero means that you are a member of a given Community to a given degree so now the question is how do we think about Links of the network um arise from this model and the way we will think about this is very similar to what we have been doing so far so we will say that",
    "100-120": " each Community A Links nodes independently and the probability that two nodes are linked due to a given Community meaning them being a member of a given Community is simply one minus the exponential of minus product of the membership strengths of the two of the two nodes in that given community so the",
    "120-140": " idea is very simple right if we are both members to that Community with to a very high degree then a product will be large um we have a minus sign here so exponential of a very large negative number is something very small so the community the total probability will be high uh for example what is also a nice",
    "140-160": " property of the product is if uh node V is for example not a member of a given community and node U is a member is a member of that Community then it will be zero times something else so the whole thing um will be zero um that is also nice and then another thing is if we have notes that are members to a given Community to varying degrees we will",
    "160-180": " take the product of the two corresponding strengths uh to compute the overall linking probability so now this is the idea of H of having a linking probability for nodes un andv belonging to a single Community a so now what happens if nodes share multiple community ities in order to achieve this",
    "180-200": " we have to first Define what we will call the community membership strength Matrix F so here is my Matrix F and let me tell you what what its structure is so this Matrix F has the number of columns which is the number of communities in our Network and the number of rows of this Matrix equals to the number of nodes of the network and",
    "200-220": " every entry of this Matrix tells us to what degree does a given node in a given row X belong to a given community in a given column okay so the what we can then do is if we think of a single row basically being a description of what of what the what are the communities a",
    "220-240": " given node is member of and to what strength is is a given node the member of that Community we can basically think that this completely specifies the community structure of our Network right for every note we know what communities it belongs to and we can think now of every every Row in this case as a simple Vector of community membership St strs",
    "240-260": " for that node so um as we have discussed now the question is how do we compute the probability of a connection the way we compute the probability of a connection is simply probability that is proportional to the product of the strengths of the two nodes so we we have already seen the equation it is simply probability of a pair of nodes being",
    "260-280": " connected due to a given Community a to be one minus the exponential of minus the product of the strengths of the community membership of nodes you and to a given Community a so now that we know How likely is a pair of nodes being connected due to a membership to a given Community a now we want to generalize this and say what if a pair of nodes has",
    "280-300": " multiple communities in common and we will use the same approach as we did with a filiation graph model we say the probability of a pair of nodes being connected is prop is proportional to the to the idea that at least one of the communities they have in common created an edge so here it is the probability of pair of nodes being connected is simply",
    "300-320": " one minus the product over the communities one minus the probability of them being connected given that they share a membership in a given community so this this formula simply says what's the probability that at least one of the communities creates a connection so what we want to do now is think about this formula a bit more and actually try to simplify it so let me show you how we",
    "320-340": " can simplify it further uh what we have so far is to say given Community a here is the probability that a pair of not is connected due to the membership to that Community then we said we said right that probability of nodes being connected in the network is proportional to the probability that at least one",
    "340-360": " common community that they have in that a pair of nodes has in common links that given pair so I have the expression from the previous slide now let's try to simplify things a bit right so the first thing I can do when I have this um value P subc I go and and insert uh and insert our um expression for the probability of",
    "360-380": " an edge and now what I notice is that the first one and the second one will cancel out so all I will be left with is a product over the uh Expo exponentials and then a product of the membership strengths uh product of the exponentials is sum of the things in the exponent so",
    "380-400": " I can I can simplify this simply to say this is one minus exponential function um and then a sum over the communities product of the corresponding strengths and then I have this minus here now what we notice is that the that the summation that we have here is simply a DOT product right it's a we are going and",
    "400-420": " multiplying the components of the two membership strands vectors together so to write this more compactly here's the expression we say that probability of node U linking to node V is simply one minus um the exponential of minus and then it's a DOT product of uh Factor basically a row for for node U and a row",
    "420-440": " for node uh V right where these rows basically tell us how to what degree is a given node um member of a given community so to give you an example here I can think of my M Matrix F where I have um the factor vectors the community strength membership vectors for the",
    "440-460": " three nodes so now I can start asking what is the probability of a given pair of nodes being connected so for example I can compute given the formula above the probability of nodes un andv being connected that is very simple it is 1 minus the the E to ra to the power of minus 16 if I do that the value is4 so",
    "460-480": " this is for nodes unv being connected here what we see is that they they have uh the only reason they they can be connected is because they share the membership to the fourth Community I can for example ask what is the probability of nodes U and W being connected here is node U here is node W what we know notice is that they have um one",
    "480-500": " community in common the same as in first case but now they both are very strong have very strong membership to that community so the overall linking probability that we compute out of this is very high but for example nodes V andw have the linking probability of zero why is that is because V and W have no common communities right in the first",
    "500-520": " case um one is a member of the first community and the second node is not and so on and so forth right so what do we what do we see from this is that kind of the model has exactly the components we would like um if nodes are members to a given Community with very high strength the probability is large if the strength",
    "520-540": " is low the linking probability is correspondingly smaller"
