    "0-20": " so in order to come up with a different mathematical formulation of this basic idea of modeling the flow we will first Define um what we will call a stochastic adjacency Matrix M and then we will express everything in terms of linear algebra in terms of basically the ranks and this Matrix M as Vector Matrix",
    "20-40": " multiplications and we will later see why this is good because we will be able to start using the linear algebra tools to implicitly solve this system of equations that I showed on the previous slide so here is how we proceed our goal is to define the stochastic Matrix M that will basically be an adjacency Matrix which basically means we want to take the graph and represent it as a big",
    "40-60": " Matrix of values and the idea is that um if a page I points to page J then um we will have a non-zero entry in the cell ji and if there is if the page page J does not point point to page I then we we will have a Zero Entry there so now",
    "60-80": " the question is what is the value of the non-zero entry in uh in in the cell of the Matrix so the idea is if I points to J then the the corresponding entry ji in The Matrix M will be one over the out degree of the of the source node so out degree of node I here you will already see what kind of where we are going",
    "80-100": " right before we said that whatever is the importance of a node this importance gets evenly split along all of its uh outlinks so this means that that the all the outlinks of node I will have the weight 1/ di so this means that our Matrix is called column stochastic this means that every column every column in",
    "100-120": " our Matrix sums to one okay so now that we have the whole graph represented as a matrix we can also take all the pagang scores of nodes and represent that as a vector okay so the way we do this is that we think that we have one entry in our Vector per page we can think that",
    "120-140": " our pages are numbered 1 2 3 4 five up to n so we have a vector of length n and every entry in this Vector basically corresponds to the page rank score of a given of a given page okay so that is all good and the other thing we know from before is that the sum of the entries of our Vector equals to one that was the constraint of the flow equations",
    "140-160": " we we had on the previous slide so now what is interesting is that we can take our flow equations kind of our basic equation and write it as a um in terms of the Matrix M and the vector R so we can write it as rank Vector R equals The Matrix M times the vector R again so now we basically have",
    "160-180": " a big system of equations right m is fixed and we want to figure out what are the values of R so just to convince you or demonstrate why why why we can take our initial flow equations and express them into this um Vector matrix product um this may not be obvious so here is",
    "180-200": " how how we can understand that what we are doing is actually true and correct so the idea is the following right imagine that I have my Matrix M here at the bottom and I have my Vector R and now I'm multiplying M * R and just for the sake of the example let's assume that um page I has the has the degree",
    "200-220": " out degree of I equals 3 and it also points which means it points to three other Pages including J this means that for a page I the the E column of Matrix M will have three nonzero elements here are indicated by squares and each of these each of these three nonzero cells we have a value of 1/3 right one over",
    "220-240": " the out degree of node I so now imagine what happens when I take the J throw and multiply it with the vector R when I'm when I'm scanning across the row here and I'm scanning down the vector the vector the vector um R I'm basically computing the pag rank score of node J",
    "240-260": " right the page rank score of node J is the sum of the importances that are stored in R times the out degree of that node that points to J so this way basically we take this initial equation that we that we had before and we express it as a vector matrix product so now we basically took our flow",
    "260-280": " formulation uh of the problem and expressed it as this um recursive in a sense Matrix equation at R equals M * R now what we observe is that this looks very much like an kind of igen value or um problem so let me just remind you what are igen values and igen vectors of",
    "280-300": " a given Matrix right so if I have a matrix a then X is called an igen Vector with the corresponding igen value Lambda if x is a solution to the equation a * x equals Lambda X okay so just saying it again a is a matrix that that we are",
    "300-320": " given X is something that we'd like to compute um and it's a vector and Lambda is also something that we'd like to compute and is a scalar is a is a real number or a complex number so the point being is that X is anigen Vector Y is igen value if they are solution to this equation ax equals Lambda X so in in our",
    "320-340": " equation looks very much similar like we have M * R which is the same as kind of a * X and then we say equals r and before um we had equals Lambda X so what this means is that rank Vector is an igen Vector of the stochastic web Matrix M and um another important fact is that",
    "340-360": " it is a principal igen Vector which means that it corresponds to the IG value with value one right so here I can think that I implicitly multiply by one and my Lambda is one right uh in fact the largest IG value of M is once ex is one exactly because m is column",
    "360-380": " stochastic um why is that the case that's the case because Vector R has a unit length meaning its coordinates Su are n are non are non- negative and they sum to one and each column of M also sums to one so M * R will be at the the value of that product of that dot",
    "380-400": " product will be at most uh at most one so this means that the that the corresponding igen value the largest igen value of our Matrix is one okay so what what did we do now so far we took our graph um represented is represented it as this big um Matrix and we reformulated our flow equations into",
    "400-420": " this um Matrix formulation and now we established the connection between the Matrix formulation and the uh igen values and igen vectors of this uh Matrix M so what what this now means is that basically instead of thinking of this as solving a system of equations we can think of of our problem as finding the IG Vector of of Matrix M and",
    "420-440": " actually there is a very efficient method for finding igen vectors of a given Matrix and this method is called Power iteration so now we actually know how to compute page rank the way to compute page rank is to find the the igen vector of Matrix M that corresponds to the igen value of with the value of",
    "440-460": " one so that's what we learned so far so now the we can actually go and compute it so let me show you what we have so far we have our little graph web graph on three nodes we have our flow equations and um we also now can write",
    "460-480": " what the structure of our Matrix M here is the structure of our Matrix M notice that the Matrix is really column stochastic so now what we can what how we can think of um our flow equations we can think of them as this Vector matrix product right so r r equal n * r"
