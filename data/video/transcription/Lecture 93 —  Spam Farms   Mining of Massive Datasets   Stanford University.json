    "0-20": " so this brings us now to the notion of spa spam farming right where the idea is what I kind of alluded to where this t-shirt seller creates a fake set of web pages that they all link to to his own web page and all these web pages in their anchor text says that the target page is about movies and this is what is known as spam farming so Google versus",
    "20-40": " spammers around two so right once the Google became a dominant search engine really spammers become become trying to figure out ways how to trick um Google search results and what they did is they created what is called spam FS where basically the idea is that we want to concentrate and collect the page Rank and kind of funnel it towards a single",
    "40-60": " um Target page and there are there is many kinds of web spam and many kinds of Link Link spam and in particular you many many times I'm sure you have visited a web page where um where you where you come and see um things like this that basically just have a set of hype links to some other web page and",
    "60-80": " the idea is exactly as I mentioned that these Pages basically funnel their page rank score importance to the to the high value Target web pages so the way we can think about this now is that we want to manipulate the structure of the of the web graph in order to create new links in such a way that given web pages will",
    "80-100": " get uh High importance conceptually we can take the web and split the web into three types of web pages we can call um we can call them these classes based on the spammer Viewpoint so for example inaccessible web pages are basically pages that the spammer cannot touch so these are pages on the rest of the web that the um spammer cannot touch then we",
    "100-120": " have a notion of accessible Pages these are basically pages that the spammer can touch so for example spammer can add fake block comments um spammer can add fake posts um to to various types of pages and all these posts would kind of point to the Target page and of course",
    "120-140": " the spammer has also its own set of pages we call this the pages the web spammer owns and these are completely controlled by the spammer and you know may spam multiple domain names there may be millions of these pages and so on so now the question is what can the spammer do um and the spammer goal right is",
    "140-160": " really to maximize the page rank score of a given page T right so there is this t-shirt selling web page let's call it page T that the web spammer wants to improve improve its page rank score so the technique the web spammer will use is that it will get many links from accessible Pages pointing to the Target page T and this way they will create a",
    "160-180": " what is called a link Forum such that the the all the page rank importances of all these Pages kind of funnel their importance back to the to our Target page te one possible um strategy for a link Farm is created here so basically this is a topology of how a link Farm may be",
    "180-200": " organized right so the blue the blue um C Cloud um shows the inaccessible part of the web then this inaccessible part of the web has in and out links to and from the accessible part of the web what the webam spammer can do make make this accessible part of the web as I said",
    "200-220": " before these are kind of block po blog posts and things like that they can create comments that that link into the target web page te and then what the web spammer can do they can take these web pages that they own and they can make all these web pages both point to the Target page T and the target page T can point back to these pages and the idea",
    "220-240": " is that there is the number of these pages is huge we will call the number of these pages to be M and think of them as millions of farm web pages because they're very cheap to to create so now this is actually one of the most common and most effective uh link fum topologies now let's start to compute and let's try to convince ourselves what",
    "240-260": " is the page rank score of note T so basically the the page we want to boost its page rank score so to do this we will do the following let's let's use the the symbol X to denote the page rank score contributed by all the accessible Pages um here denoted as blue node um",
    "260-280": " and how much page rank they contribute to T and let's use the Y to be the to be the page rank score of note T so now first thing we want to compute is what is the paging score of every of the fum pages that the web spammer owns that is very easy to compute we know what is the score of um node T and it is only the note T that links to the to the far",
    "280-300": " pages so the note T takes its page and score y divides it evenly among all the M pages that are owned by the by the spammer and gives them a beta fraction of of its page rank score uh to each one of them and then of course each of these um owned spam pages also receives a",
    "300-320": " fraction of the score due to the random jumps the random jumps happen with probability 1 minus beta and there is n pages in total on the web so that is 1 minus beta Over N so now given that we now know what is the score of every web page that we own this is denoted as red notes let's also compute what is the",
    "320-340": " value of y so the value of y y is the page rank score of note uh T is simply X which is the amount of page rank contributed by the access Pages plus beta time M and now the um the pages uh the contribution of page rank scores from the pages that we own so this is beta * y / M plus 1 - beta + n um plus 1",
    "340-360": " minus beta divided by n where M now is the number of pages that the spammer owns and N is the number of pages that are total on the web okay so if you think think about this and um multiply",
    "360-380": " uh with beta beta M and solve the system what we what we get is that Y = X + beta 2 y plus some uh constant terms all right and what we will do is we will take this last term one 1 minus beta Over N this is very small because the web is huge n is large so we will we",
    "380-400": " will ignore this one so let's keep looking at what do we get what we basically get is we get something that is like y equal x over 1 - beta 2 plus um m / n plus some constant where this constant is beta over beta + one okay um",
    "400-420": " m is the number of pages that the spammer owns and N is the number of pages uh that are on the web so what this means is that the paging score of our Target page T equals basically the amount of paging score that comes from the accessible part of the web plus the ratio of M to n multiplied by some",
    "420-440": " constant so what does this mean is basically that the the more web pages the web spammer owns the bigger the M the higher the score of the target page y will be so in some sense web spammer can create arbitrary large number of pages so M can be arbitrarily large which means that the page rank score of the target page T can also get",
    "440-460": " arbitrarily large and of course in reality n is huge right the size of the web graph is huge and M um doesn't need to be that large because all we need to do is we need to boost the the score of the target page T not to be the most important page on the web but to be more",
    "460-480": " important than than some other pages on the web so even not not to Big link Farms can already have a big effect right so now this is basically the problem and the question is how do we now go and detect such links link Farms on the web"
