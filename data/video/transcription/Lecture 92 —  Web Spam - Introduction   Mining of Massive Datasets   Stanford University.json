    "0-20": " next we will look at the problem of web spam so the problem actually became very important with the rise of the web search engines so let me first define what do I mean by web spam right so spamming it's really any deliberate activity to boost the score of a web page or the web page",
    "20-40": " position in the search engine result page right and this means that basically what what the goal is to kind of boost the value of a given page so spam in some sense are web pages that are the result of spamming and actually there is a whole industry of people in some sense that are trying to do this and this is",
    "40-60": " what is called as search engine optimization right and there is a kind of gray line in these people might disagree but basically the idea is how do we boost an importance of a given page on the web and make make sure it appears let's say on the first page of Google or Bing results and it has been estimated at around 10 to 15 percent of web pages on the web are actually spam so how did spam web spam really work so",
    "60-80": " early search engines operated the following way they would go and crawl the web so basically they would go and collect the web pages they would then index the web pages by the words they contained and then whenever somebody searched they would basically look at the given web page see how much does it",
    "80-100": " mention the words in the search query and then it would rank the search results based on the number of times they mentioned a given search query term so what this means is that basically the idea for the initial ranking was to attempt to order pages by matching Acquia search query by importance which",
    "100-120": " means that basically the search engines would would consider the number of times a query words appeared on the web page and maybe also the prominence of the word position whether that word was in the title or in the header of a web page so now that also is very allows us to nicely-nicely spam and exploit this idea",
    "120-140": " so imagine the following imagine that when people began using the search engines for on the web those that with the commercial interests may be people that are wanting to sell something they want to exploit the search engines and make sure that people go and visit their own pages right so the idea is",
    "140-160": " kind of we want our page to appear as high as high on the web search rankings as possible regardless of whether that is that page is really relevant to a given topic or not right because driving traffic to a website is good so let's look at the example where we have a t-shirt reseller who wants to appear high on the whenever people search about",
    "160-180": " movies maybe this t-shirt reseller is selling movie related t-shirts so he wants to be as high as possible whenever somebody searches for the word movies right and the technique to achieve this boosting the relevance or importance of a webpage this is really what we mean by spam so here is how how the first spammers did this this is called term",
    "180-200": " spam so the idea is the following right the idea is that for our t-shirt seller he creates the web page and then once to a peerless web page to really seem to be about movies so what the web seller can do is he can take the word movie and insert the Mortain movie 1000 times in the web page and usually how this was",
    "200-220": " done in the early days of the web is that we would have a web page where on the top was the legitimate text and at the bottom was a huge list of words and the text color of these words was the same as the color of the web background so kind of they wouldn't bother the user who comes to the web page but the web search engine would see these words and",
    "220-240": " would think that this particular web page is all about movies right and now of course when somebody will see and run a query on movies this web page would appear to be all about movies and the person would go and get it ranked higher so this and similar techniques to this",
    "240-260": " one are called term spam let's look at how Google came up with a solution to combat term spam so the basic idea in the basic intuition here is that rather than believing what the page says about itself let's believe other people what they say about the page so in our context this means that we want to look",
    "260-280": " at the anchor text so this is the blue text underlying the hyperlink what does that text say about the Paige that it is linked to so in some sense the idea is that we are able to find web pages and surface them out even if even for queries for the words that the web page itself doesn't even mention but other web pages on the web may",
    "280-300": " mention that word when referring to the target page and of course now we already know how we can use PageRank so we can think of PageRank as a tool to measure importance of web pages on the web through this idea of the anchor text and the question is why does this method works right in our hypothetical t-shirt",
    "300-320": " seller example basically the we can combat him in a sense that now say if it was very easy for the for the t-shirt seller to say to put a word movies on the web page many times and say hey I'm really about movies and not about t-shirt but from the t-shirt sellers perspective it is very hard to convince other pages on the web to link now to",
    "320-340": " our tailor's t-shirt seller's web page and say that this web page is about movies of course and this is now where we are basically coming to the notion of web spam where the idea is that what a web seller can do now they can go and create 1000 web pages that each link to his t-shirt seller web page and each of",
    "340-360": " these thousand web pages use a word movie in in the anchor text and this way for example now we are having the notion of web spam where the idea is that these web pages have are creating false links to our t-shirt seller web page and this way boost the importance of the page of",
    "360-380": " course one thing is now that for example these pages have no endings so they will get very very little web page page rank score and this page may still be linked low so the web the t-shirt seller person it's very hard for them for them for example to beat a truly movie related",
    "380-400": " web page like IMDB of course even this scheme can be beaten for example if there are big coordinated efforts where people put a given anchor text and link to a given target page then what can happen is that this given target page can be ranked very high even though it doesn't mention a word and here is an",
    "400-420": " example about a coordinated effort about a given query and about a given target page"
